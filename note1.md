##Whats An Object?

In computer science, an object is a location in memory that has a value and can be referred to by an identifier. It can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method. In object-oriented programming, an object is an instance of a class that can be a variable, a function, a data structure, or a combination of these. Understanding objects and their properties is essential in both CS and OOP.
